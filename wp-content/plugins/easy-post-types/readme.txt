Create custom WordPress post types on the fly with an easy to use interface. Then manage custom fields and categories for your post types.

== Description ==

This plugin lets you take advantage of the Wordpress 3.0 custom post type feature, and create your own post type. The plugin allows you to add a set of fields attached to your new post type, so that in the edit and add new windows a new box will show with the fields defined. Each field added will be saved in the Wordpress Database as a custom field, so that you can take advantage of the standard Wordpress query rules to list your content on the page template.

This can be caused by having a page with the same slug as your custom post type key. The Page does not need to be published (it can even be in the trash) for this issue to exists.

You will either need to permanently delete the Page or create the a new post type with a different key.

This is an issue with WordPress rewrite. We are looking into how to workaround the issue.
